The [Vanilla JS Slack Community](https://vanillajs.slack.com) is a place to ask questions, work through any vanilla JS challenges, and share ideas and best practices.

The following guidelines are intended to make the community easier and more enjoyable to use.

**By joining the Vanilla JS Slack Community, you agree that you have read and will follow this Code of Conduct, and that you are at least 18 years old.**

1. [Getting Started](#getting-started)
2. [A Few Details](#a-few-details)
3. [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct)
4. [No Trump Policy](#no-trump-policy)

## Getting Started

1. Set up your profile. Upload a photo and create a short bio.
2. Introduce yourself and tell the room a little about what you do.
3. This is a single-channel Slack. All of the convo happens in the `#vanilla-js` channel.
4. We make heavy use of *threads* to keep conversations organized.
5. If your favorite topic isn’t being discussed, bring it up!
6. All are welcome to contribute regardless of their experience or skill level. If you want to hang back and lurk, that’s cool, too.
7. We expect that we’ll treat others with respect. We encourage debate; we ask for patience, and we remind you that you’re here to learn and that means being open a diverse set of ideas. See the [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct) below.

## A Few Details

- To foster more accountability for what people post, no anonymous display names are allowed.
- No one has signed an NDA to participate in this Slack, and you should not presume anything you say here will remain private, so act accordingly. Protect IP and legally-protected information.
- If you want to publicly disclose anything discussed here, use [Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about/chatham-house-rule) as the guideline ("participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed").
- Membership in this Slack Team is a privilege, not a right, and you can be kicked out at any time. See the [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct) below.

## Code of Conduct

### The Short Version

Be respectful of other people, respectfully ask people to stop if you are bothered, and if you can’t resolve an issue contact the administrators. If you're being a problem, you can be kicked out of the Slack channel.

### The Long Version

#### Respect

The Vanilla JS Slack is an intentionally positive community that recognizes and celebrates the creativity and collaboration of independent members and the diversity of skills, talents, experiences, cultures, and opinions that they bring to our community.

The Vanilla JS Slack is an inclusive environment, based on treating all individuals respectfully, regardless of gender or gender identity (including nonbinary or transgender status), sexual orientation, age, disability, nationality, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or career path.

We value respectful behavior above individual opinions. Respectful behavior includes:

- Be considerate, kind, constructive, and helpful.
- Avoid demeaning, discriminatory, harassing, hateful, or physically threatening behavior, speech, and imagery.
- If you’re not sure, ask someone instead of assuming. No, really. Just ask the administrators. We’d rather hear from you than hear about something you said or did after the fact, and we are here to help.
- Don’t be a bystander. Role model respectful behavior, but also help to address disrespect when you see it.

#### Resolve Peacefully

We believe peer-to-peer discussions, feedback, and corrections can help build a stronger, safer, and more welcoming community.

If you see someone behaving disrespectfully, we urge you to respectfully dissuade them from such behavior. Expect that others in the community wish to help keep the community respectful, and welcome your input in doing so.

If you experience disrespectful behavior toward yourself or anyone else and feel in any way unable or unwilling to respond or resolve it respectfully (for any reason), please immediately [bring it to the attention of an administrator](#administrators). We want to hear from you about anything that you feel is disrespectful, threatening, or just something that could make someone feel distressed in any way.

If that person in question *is* one of the administrators, please bring the issue to the attention of one of the others. Their job is to hold each other accountable, and ensure that everyone feels safe and welcome.

We will listen and work to resolve the matter.

#### Apologize for Mistakes

Should you catch yourself behaving disrespectfully, or be confronted as such, listen intently, own up to your words and actions, and apologize accordingly.

No one is perfect, and even well-intentioned people make mistakes. What matters is how you handle them and that you avoid repeating them in the future.

#### Consequences

If the administrators determine that someone is behaving disrespectfully, the administrators may take any action they deem appropriate within this Slack community up to and including expulsion and exclusion from the Team.

As administrators, we will seek to resolve conflicts peacefully and in a manner that is positive for the community.

We can’t foresee every situation, and thus if in the administrator's judgment the best thing to do is to ask a disrespectful individual to leave, we will do so.

#### Administrators

The administrator(s) of the Vanilla JS Slack Community as of December 12, 2016:

## No Trump Policy

**To support President Trump is to inherently violate the terms of the the Code of Conduct.**

Trump and his campaign are racist, sexist, anti-disability, anti-LGBTQ, and anti-international. Throughout his campaign and presidency he has mocked people different from him, treating people he deems inferior with cruelty and contempt.

We have many wonderful students with diverse backgrounds, ethnicities, gender identities, and sexual orientations. We have students from countries that President Trump vilifies.

**To support Trump is to risk making those students feel uncomfortable, unwelcome, or unsafe, and that is unacceptable to me.**

We believe that you end up with the community that you deserve.

We love this community, and wonderful, supportive group we’ve become. We believe our job is to make sure it remains a place where people can be themselves, grow, and learn.

**As a result, Trump supporters cannot join the Vanilla JS Slack.**
