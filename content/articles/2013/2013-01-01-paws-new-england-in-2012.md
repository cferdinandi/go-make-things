title: PAWS New England in 2012

I'm the web guy for <a href="http://www.pawsnewengland.com/">PAWS New England</a>, an all-breed dog rescue. In 2012, they saved the lives of  nearly 700 dogs. That's almost two dogs a day, every day for a year. Awesome!

Here are a few of <a href="https://vimeo.com/56563143">the many dogs they saved in 2012...</a>
