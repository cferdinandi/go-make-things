<blockquote>Life is really just beautiful moments, one right after the other.</blockquote>

Zach was a 17 year old diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a rare form of bone cancer. When it spread to his lungs and pelvis, he was given just months to live. And wow, did he live. What an amazing person and a beautiful family.

Zach passed away on May 20, 2013.

<blockquote>I want to be remembered as a kid who went down fighting... and didn't really lose.</blockquote>
