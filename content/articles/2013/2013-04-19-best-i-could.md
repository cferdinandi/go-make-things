My friend <a href="http://danmills.net/">Dan Mills</a> is an amazingly talented musician. In addition to writing beautiful songs, he also had a cameo on the TV show <a href="http://www.nbc.com/smash/">Smash</a> last season.

Check out his new single, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvi_Lsp0swI">Best I Could...</a>
