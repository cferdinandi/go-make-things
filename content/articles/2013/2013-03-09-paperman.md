I've mentioned before that I'm fascinated by Pixar's ability to <a href="https://gomakethings.com/stories-without-words/">tell stories without words</a>. Here's another example of beautiful, dialogue-free storytelling in their latest animated short, <a href="http://www.hulu.com/watch/455789">Paperman...</a>

(<em>Sorry for making you watch the Hulu version with a 30 second ad up front. The version <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTLySbGoMX0">Pixar had uploaded to YouTube</a> was later set to private and is no longer viewable.</em>)
