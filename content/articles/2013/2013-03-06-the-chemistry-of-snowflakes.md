Ever wonder how snowflakes form? Bytesize Science shares this interesting video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?&v=VYrF3sFBY20">the chemistry of snowflakes...</a>

The two things I'm most amazed by:

<ol>
<li>A snowflake often starts as tiny grain of dust floating in the clouds. When water sticks to it and freezes, a snowflake is born.</li>
<li>While the saying, "No two snowflakes are alike" may be true for larger snowflakes, it's actually not true for smaller snowflakes that fall to Earth early on in the process.</li>
</ol>

Watch the video for more!
