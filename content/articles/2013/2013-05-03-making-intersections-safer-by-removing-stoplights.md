title: Making intersections safer by removing stoplights
---

The town of Poyton, England took a counterintuitive approach to making their streets and intersections safer for pedestrians and cars alike: they removed traffic signals, curbs, and crosswalks.

The street designers behind this transformation point out that it's actually a return to the way city roadways were traditionally structured until about 50 or 60 years ago. And it's resulted in a safer, less-congested space for cars and pedestrians alike.
