Macklemore's high-energy radio singles are getting a lot of play, but I'm really impressed by "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlVBg7_08n0">Same Love</a>," a beautifully heartfelt song from his latest album.

You don't often see this level of vulnerability and honesty in hip-hop. This song gives me chills.
