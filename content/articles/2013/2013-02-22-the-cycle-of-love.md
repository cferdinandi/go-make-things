If you live in the US, you've probably seen that new Verizon commercial where <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG2DRiQt1b0">the guy rides his bike around San Francisco in the shape of a heart</a>, tracks it with a smartphone app, and sends the resulting image to his girlfriend.

Turns out, that's a true story, and the guy in the ad is actually the guy who did it. <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/krulwich/2013/02/13/171902975/guy-pumps-out-a-valentine-literally">From NPR...</a>

<blockquote>Last year, Payam Rajabi got a new job and had to leave Toronto and his girlfriend, Clare, and move to San Francisco. All that left him feeling a little down â€” until he came up with his upsy, downsy valentine idea.

He jumped on his bike, opened his iPhone to a map of San Francisco, and tracking himself with a GPS, he rode 27 miles around the city, taking 2 1/2 hours, burning 1,135 calories and carefully etching a heart shape onto a city map ... like this ... all for Clare.</blockquote>

I find it interesting that Payam used his iPhone, but the commercial is for a Droid.
