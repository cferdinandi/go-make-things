title: A tour of the International Space Station
---

In her final days as Commander of the International Space Station (ISS), Sunita Williams of NASA recorded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doN4t5NKW-k">an extensive tour of the space craft</a>.

Williams provides a lot of detail on the day-to-day life aboard the ISS. Learn how astronauts eat, exercise, sleep, and even use the bathroom.

One thing I was struck by is how cluttered it feels. Everything is strapped down, of course, but with space at a premium (excuse the pun), gear and supplies are everywhere. I was also surprised to see so many exposed cables and wires. I would be afraid of snagging one while moving through the station and breaking something.

If you stick it out to around 12 minutes, you'll be treated to some amazing views of Earth from the cupola viewing dome. And at about 15 minutes in, Williams shows off how cool weightlessness really is. You may notice throughout the video that there are straps and handles everywhere to help with movement.
