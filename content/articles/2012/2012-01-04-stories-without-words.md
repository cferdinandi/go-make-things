title: Stories without words
---

I'm fascinated by Pixar's ability to tell beautiful stories without words. If you want to become a better storyteller, studying what they do is a great place to start.

One of my favorite examples is at the beginning of the movie <em>Up</em>. There's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yjAFMNkCDo">a wonderful montage</a> that tells the story of Carl Fredricksen and his wife, Ellie. Not a single word is uttered, but it's beautiful, powerful and moving.

<strong>Some things I noticed...</strong>
<ul>
<li>The montage uses just one, simple melody. Notice, though, how the tone, tempo and styling changes based on the mood of the scene.</li>
<li>Colors and lighting play an important storytelling role. Happy scenes are brightly lit and cheery. Sad scenes aren't just dark and shadowy. The colors themselves are duller and less vibrant.</li>
<li>Simplicity is a great storytelling vehicle. The folks at Pixar do a great job at directing you to a single facial expression, a single action, a single piece of body language, to drive the story.</li>
<li> Repetition creates familiarity. The hammer smashing the glass jug. The role of the "My Adventure Book." The use of balloons (which of course is foreshadowing of a bigger plot twist).</li>
</ul>
