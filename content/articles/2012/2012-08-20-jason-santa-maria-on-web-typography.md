title: Jason Santa Maria on Web Typography
---

<a href="http://jasonsantamaria.com/">Jason Santa Maria</a>, designer and Creative Director for <a href="https://typekit.com/">Typekit</a>, gave an awesome <a href="https://vimeo.com/34178417">talk on web typography for the Build Conference</a> this year.

It's a bit long at 42 minutes, but worth watching. My thoughts after the video.

<h2>My Takeaways</h2>

<h3>No typeface is evil.</h3>

Yes, that includes Comic Sans. It's not the typeface that's the problem - it's how you use it.

Comic Sans is actually a great choice for comic books (which is what it was actually modeled after). Financial communications? Not so much.

<h3>Type is a beautiful group of letters, not a group of beautiful letters.</h3>

Typography isn't just about choosing a pretty font. It's about the relationship of the letters with each other to form words, sentences and paragraphs.

<h3>Most information is in the top half of a letter.</h3>

There's one part in the video where Jason covers up the bottom half of a sentence, and you can still read the sentence easily. Then he covers up the top half, and it becomes completely unreadable.

Most of the information a letter conveys occurs in the top half. Who knew?

<h3>Some basic principles...</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Achieve hierarchy through contrast.</strong> Big vs. small. Bold and italic vs. regular.</li>
<li><strong>It's better to set type too big than too small.</strong> Unfortunately, far too many websites are set too small for today's high resolution screens. In most cases, use 16 pixels as a minimum.</li>
<li><strong>Longer line length requires more line spacing.</strong> That is all.</li>
</ol>

<h2>What are my working typefaces?</h2>

Near the end of his talk, Jason mentions that some of the best designers have built their careers using just a small collection of working types.

(Working types are typefaces that work well in a range of sizes and applications.)

Jason argues that there's a real value spending time getting to know a typeface really well - in learning it's quirks and understanding it's strengths and weaknesses. It got me wondering: what are my working typefaces?

If I had to pick right now, I'd say Georgia, Helvetica Neue, Museo Slab and Museo Sans. I'm also really excited about <a href="https://gomakethings.com/source-sans-pro-from-adobe/">Source Sans Pro</a>, and am looking forward to incorporating that into my designs. I hope Adobe releases a complementing serif at some point in the future, too.

What are your takeaways from the talk?
