title: NASA Remembers Neil Armstrong
---

NASA released this beautiful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pQKZc2AXW0">tribute to Neil Armstrong</a>.

Two things stand out for me:
<ol>
<li>His focus on team work and putting everyone else ahead of himself. I need to do more of that.</li>
<li>That anything is possible if you throw yourself at it. He's the first person on the planet to step foot on a celestial body outside of earth. And he did it at a time when a computer that filled a room had less computing power than your iPhone. Amazing.</li>
</ol>
