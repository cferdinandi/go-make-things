This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGxKhUuZ0Rc">hilarious Siri Scotland spoof</a> had me in stitches. (<em><strong>Warning:</strong> lots bad language</em>)

I love my iPhone, but even in American english Siri doesn't know what I'm saying half the time. It's actually gotten worse over the last month or two.
