There are two things I love about this video of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nifq3Ke2Q30">Derek Redmond from the 1992 Summer Olympics</a>:

<ol>
<li>Despite being in what I imagine is quite a bit of pain, he gets back up and starts running again anyways.</li>
<li>The way Redmond's father pushes away the officials who are trying to usher him off the field. Sometimes doing the right thing means breaking the rules.</li>
</ol>
