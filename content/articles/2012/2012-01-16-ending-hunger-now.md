---

In this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdxVbUja_pY">absolutely stunning TED Talk</a>, Josette Sheeran, the head of the UN's World Food Program, talks about why, in a world with enough food for everyone, people still go hungry and still die of starvation.

She also offers a few simple ideas on how we can end hunger now.

<h2>Ending hunger now</h2>

There's one incredibly simple way to save lives today. For just 20-cents, the United Nations manufactures <a href="http://www.wfp.org/nutrition/special-nutritional-products">non-perishable packs of food</a>. Just one of these packs can mean the difference between life and death for someone who's malnurished.

Of course, that's addresses the symptom, not the cause.

<h2>It's all about local</h2>

<blockquote>Production isn't the problem... access is.</blockquote>

In her talk, Josette shared a few of the projects the World Food Program has had success running. Among all of them is a central theme: local.

By providing people with access to local food, and farmers access to local markets, you can kickstart a stagnant food economy.
