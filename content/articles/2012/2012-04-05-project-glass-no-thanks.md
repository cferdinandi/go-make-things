title: Project Glass? No thanks!

This week the big topic on the interwebz is <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/111626127367496192147/posts">Project Glass</a>, the new augmented reality vision from Google. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6W4CCU9M4">Here it is in action...</a>

It's worth noting that this isn't real, ready to ship technology. It's a concept video. Those seem to be really popular nowadays - both Microsoft and RIM also shared not-so-distant future videos in the last year. But I digress.

Even if this were a real product, I have no interest in it. We already suffer from information overload. I deliberately turn off push notifications for pretty much everything on my phone.

Why would I want to walk around with a plate of glass sitting between me and my view of the world? And why would I want that plate of glass to constantly interrupt what I'm doing?
