title: Mind-Controlled Robotic Arm
---

Researchers at Brown University (in my home state of Rhode Island) have developed <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/16/3025072/mind-controlled-robotic-arm-study">a robotic arm that can be controlled by thought</a>.

This is simply amazing, and the future potential of such devices for people who are paralyzed is extraordinary.
