A few of my friends give me a hard time because I watch So You Think You Can Dance. Enthusiastically.

A few awesome hip-hop routines sucked me in, but I've since discovered that I appreciate a wide range of dance styles. But my favorite thing about the show is when I get to see amazing and innovative stuff.

This season, Cyrus "Glitch" Spencer brought a style known as "animation" to the show. It's jaw-dropping. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8-idNxPAnI">Check it out...</a>
