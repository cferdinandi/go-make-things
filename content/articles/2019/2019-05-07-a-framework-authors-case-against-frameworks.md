Back in 2017, Adrian Holovaty gave a talk a DotJS titled, "[A framework author's case against frameworks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvOsegaN9Wk)."

I just game across it for the first time the other day, and found myself nodding vigorously throughout the whole thing.

The tl;dr: over time, they become a big collection of patch-fixes and feature enhancements for a variety of needs and edge cases that likely don't reflect your own.

One of the big features I see touted when it comes to frameworks is that you get the collective battle testing and bug fixing of many developers and teams from around the world. But that comes with a price: bloat.
