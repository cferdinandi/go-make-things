Last month, I gave a talk at Boston CSS on the The Web. The talk wasn't recorded, but I just put together a video of the talk so you can watch it anyways.

I'll be making some changes based on questions I got from the audience, but I thought it was better to get something out there now rather than wait until itâ€™s perfect.

[Here's the video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J0SPMFjXvs)

<div class="fluid-vids"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3J0SPMFjXvs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

If you want me to give this talk at your conference or organization, sent me an email and let me know.
