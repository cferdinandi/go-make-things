title: The Stories You Haven&#8217;t Heard
---

I heard about this cool new web app from <a href="http://www.swiss-miss.com/2011/03/proust.html">Tina over at Swiss-Miss</a> called <a href="http://www.proust.com/">Proust</a>. The gist? It gives you a list of questions you can ask you parents, grandparents, friends, and so on to help start conversations and help them share the awesome stories from their life you haven't heard.

I love the concept, but I'm not sure I dig it as a web app. That's not really something the people I'd love to hear this stuff from would use.

I'm tempted to use Proust to get some conversation question ideas, and use a flip cam or digital voice recorder to run an interview. It would make for some great mini-documentaries of photo slideshow narratives.

Thoughts?
