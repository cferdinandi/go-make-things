title: Conan O&#8217;Brien at Dartmouth 2011

Last week, Conan O'Brien delivered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmDYXaaT9sA">an amazing commencement speech at Dartmouth College</a>.

My favorite takeaway after the video...

If there's an overarching theme to the second half of Conan's speech, it's this: Your dreams and your path in life are ever changing and unpredictable. Embrace it, try new things, and throw yourself into whatever life gives you with gusto.

Or as Conan said...

<blockquote>It is our failure to become our perceived ideal that ultimately defines us and makes us unique.</blockquote>
