<em><strong>Update (March 17, 2012):</strong> It came out this week that large portions of Mike Daisey's story are outright fabrications. You can read more about it on <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/blog/2012/03/retracting-mr-daisey-and-the-apple-factory">This American Life</a>, and also see <a href="http://mikedaisey.blogspot.com/2012/03/statement-on-tal.html">Mike's response here</a>.</em>

<blockquote>When you export your jobs around the world, you should be exporting your values.
