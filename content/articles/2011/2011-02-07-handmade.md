It's so rare to find handmade things anymore, which is why I love the two small businesses profiled in the first season of <a href="http://putthison.com/">Put This On</a>, a web series about dressing like a grown up.

In the first episode, they talked to <a href="http://vimeo.com/7391362">Mike Hodis of Rising Sun Jeans</a>.

At $500 a pop, I won't be buying a pair of his jeans anytime soon, but he uses traditional jean-making techniques and antique sewing machines. His jeans include features you don't find on modern jeans, like cinches (<em>which were used before belts and belt loops were common</em>).

His jeans are imperfect because they're handmade. If you're making great stuff, that's something you should embrace.

In the second episode, they interviewed <a href="http://vimeo.com/11075261">Raul Ojeda of Willie's Shoe Service</a>, one of the few places in America where you can still buy custom-made shoes. I wish I could find a place like this near me!

These videos are also a fantastic example of well-made web videos. They're well-produced but not overly flashy, and they're filled with rock-solid content.

I'm looking forward to future episodes!
