title: Protests in Egypt
---

So many people in the US, myself included, take for granted the immense amount of freedom we have to say and do things. Watching this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWr6MypZ-JU">video of the protests going on in Egypt</a> right now was a moving and not-so-subtle reminder.

If you don't want to sit through all three minutes, jump to the 1:25 mark and watch protesters stand down Egyptian riot police and water cannons.

It's amazing to think that just a generation ago black people in this country were blasted with water cannons because they understood that separate is never equal. It's amazing to think that right now gays and lesbians in this country still don't have equal rights under the law.

And it's amazing that in countries around the world, people don't have the freedom to say what I'm saying right now.
