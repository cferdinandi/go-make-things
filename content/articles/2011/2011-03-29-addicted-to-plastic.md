title: Addicted to Plastic
---

I've written about <a href="https://gomakethings.com/soda-sustainability/">my disdain of plastic bottles</a>. I've also featured a cool project to <a href="https://gomakethings.com/trash-track/">track where our trash ends up</a>.

Here's a beautifully tragic video from photographer Chris Jordan on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GudEuDTrSLU">the destruction our love of plastic causes</a>. Let's do something to change this. Let's break our addiction to plastic.

Ideas?
