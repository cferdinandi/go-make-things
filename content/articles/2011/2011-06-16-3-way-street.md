3-Way Street is a short video by <a href="http://blog.ronconcocacola.com/">Ron Gabriel</a> exploring <a href="http://vimeo.com/24572222">the interconnectedness of cars, pedestrians and cyclists in NYC</a>.

<blockquote>By summer 2010, the expansion of bike lanes in NYC exposed a clash of long-standing bad habits - such as pedestrians jaywalking, cyclists running red lights, and motorists plowing through crosswalks.

By focusing on one intersection as a case study, my video aims to show our interconnection and shared role in improving the safety and usability of our streets.

This is definitely fun to watch. The only thing missing for me is some form of recommendation or solution.

What do you think? How would you solve this problem?
