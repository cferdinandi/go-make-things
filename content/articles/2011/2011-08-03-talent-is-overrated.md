title: Talent is Overrated
---

Back in April, illustrator <a href="http://vimeo.com/22752100">Christoph Niemann gave a brilliant talk</a> for the <a href="http://www.creativemornings.com/">CreativeMornings</a> series on talent, effort, and finding time to make awesome things.

My favorite takeaway (I'm paraphrasing here)...

<blockquote>Talent is overrated. It implies a natural gift. Great ideas are 87% effort, 7.5% luck, 0.5% talent and divine inspiration, and 5% staying off the internet for 90 consecutive minutes!</blockquote>

<a href="http://www.creativemornings.com/">CreativeMornings</a> is a monthly breakfast lecture series for creative types.

Founded by <a href="http://www.swiss-miss.com/">Tina Roth Eisenberg of Swiss Miss</a>, it started as a small gathering in New York City, and has since spread to six locations, with two more on the way. All of the lectures are available for free online.
