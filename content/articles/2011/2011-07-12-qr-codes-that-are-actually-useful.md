title: QR codes that are actually useful
---

I generally dislike <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code">QR codes</a>.

If you're not familiar with them, they're a weird looking square barcode that you scan by taking a photo with your smart phone. Using a special app, the QR code can take you to a website, add contact info to your phone or more.

Sounds good. So why do I dislike them? Because they generally seem like an afterthought tossed onto packaging to fill empty space.

<h2>Tesco Korea's brilliant use of QR codes</h2>

Supermarket chain Tesco Korea has used QR codes in a brilliant way. Their challenge: Become the number one grocery store in Korea without increasing the number of stores.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJVoYsBym88">Tesco recreated an entire grocery store with signage in Korean subways.</a> The layout and items were identical to those in their actual stores. Each item was labeled with a QR code. People waiting for their train could simply scan the QR codes to add items to their list, and have them delivered while they ride the train.

Tesco sales increased 130% without adding a single store. Brilliant!
