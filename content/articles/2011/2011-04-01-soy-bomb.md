On the way to work the other day, the Wallflowers song "Fifth Avenue Heartache" came on the radio.

I started wondering what happened to them, and then remember that Jakob Dylan, the lead singer, was the son of the Bob Dylan. And oddly, thinking of Bob Dylan made me remember the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_RIGzk3iTQ">1998 Soy Bomb incident</a>.

During his 1998 Grammy performance, artist Michael Portnoy rushed on stage shirtless with the words "SOY BOMB" painted on his chest. When asked about it, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Portnoy">he explained</a>:

<blockquote>"Soy... represents dense nutritional life. Bomb is, obviously, an explosive destructive force. So, soy bomb is what I think art should be: dense, transformational, explosive life.</blockquote>

We need more crazy artists in the world. I didn't really get Michael's performance. Most people didn't. And that's what makes it so beautiful.
