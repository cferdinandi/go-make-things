title: Death to Pennies!
---

Back in college, I spent 5 months studying abroad in Australia. They had stopped using pennies, instead simply rounding up or down to the nearest five cents.

It was awesome! Pennies are heavy, and they're a pain in the ass to deal with.

(Australia has dollar coins though, which are even heavier than pennies. If I had to pick, I'd rather keep pennies and use dollar bills.)

Last week <a href="http://www.danpink.com/archives/2011/12/death-to-pennies">Dan Pink shared</a> this awesome video advocating that it's time for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5UT04p5f7U">US to discontinue the penny</a>. I agree!
