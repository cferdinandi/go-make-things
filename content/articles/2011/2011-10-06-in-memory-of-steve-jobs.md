title: In Memory of Steve Jobs

Steve Jobs passed away yesterday.

His work has had a tremendous influence on me. The importance of great work. The focus on user experience and simplicity.

There will no doubt be many tributes and old videos of Steve popping up over the next few days. Today, I wanted to share my favorite one - his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc">2005 Stanford University Commencement speech</a>.

<h2>Noteworthy</h2>

<blockquote>You can't connect the dots looking forward. You can only connect them looking backwards.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma – which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of other’s opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.</blockquote>

<blockquote>We’re here to put a dent in the universe. Otherwise why else even be here?</blockquote>

I'm also inspired today by <a href="http://twitter.com/tom_peters">Tom Peters</a>, who tweeted...

<blockquote>Don't get weepy about Steve's passing. Get your butt in gear and live today as he did every day! Challenge! Challenge! Challenge! The way to honor Steve Jobs is to take your current project [today] and turn it upside down and shake it up with all your might!</blockquote>

Go make your dent...
