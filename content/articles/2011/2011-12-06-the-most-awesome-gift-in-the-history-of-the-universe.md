What if I told you there was a way for you to save a life this holiday season, and increase the cuteness of your household by a factor of 17?

<a href="http://pawsnewengland.com/">PAWS New England</a>, an amazing animal rescue organization that I do web design work for, has teamed up with <a href="http://www.petfinder.com">Petfinder.com</a> in a national effort to help empty shelters across the country and place homeless pets in loving foster and adoptive homes for the holidays.

<strong>If they empty their sanctuary by December 10, they can go to Tipton County pound (where only one or two dogs come out for every ten that go in) and empty it completely for Christmas.</strong>
