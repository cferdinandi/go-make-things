<a href="http://vimeo.com/21894812">The Safety Net</a> is a really smart concept by Dan Watson, a student at the Royal College of Art in London.

Dan's system uses design-thinking and marine behavior to produce a trawling net that's better for the environment <em>and</em> fishermen's bottom-lines. While it doesn't address the overfishing that trawling causes, it's a great start!

You can vote for Dan's design in the <a href="http://timetocare.victorinox.com/en/nc/vote-win/safetynet.html">Time to Care competition</a>.
