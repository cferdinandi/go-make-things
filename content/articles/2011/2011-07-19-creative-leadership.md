<blockquote>The role of a creative leader is not to have all the ideas; it’s to create a culture where everyone can have ideas and feel that they’re valued.

I'm really looking forward to picking up <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Out-Our-Minds-Learning-Creative/dp/1841121258">Out of Minds: Learning to be Creative</a></em> by Sir Ken Robinson.

After watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG9CE55wbtY">his brilliant TED Talk on creativity</a>, I have no doubt this book will be awesome.
