<a href="http://www.presentationzen.com/">Garr Reynolds of Presentation Zen</a> has had a huge influence on how I present and convey ideas visually.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g8T8MsFIp0">Lessons from the Bamboo</a>, his recent talk at <a href="http://tedxtokyo.com/">TEDxTokyo</a>, did not disappoint.

<blockquote>Everything - even mountains, rivers, plants and trees - should be your teacher.

- Morihei Ueshiba</blockquote>

This reminds me of something <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkCxoo7pd4A">Craig McQuilken, a Senior Program Delivery Manager at EMC</a>, once told me: "Don't try to figure out [who you should listen to]. Find the one thing everyone you meet is really good at and learn from that."
