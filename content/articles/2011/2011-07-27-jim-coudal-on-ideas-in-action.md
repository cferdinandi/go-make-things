---

<a href="http://coudal.com/">Jim Coudal of Coudal Partners</a> was the first speaker for the Chicago chapter of <a href="http://www.creativemornings.com/">Creative Mornings</a>.

<a href="http://vimeo.com/26133811">Jim spoke about</a> his transition from client work to selling his own products, and how to put ideas in action. My favorite insights after the video...

<h2>My Key Takeaways</h2>

There's a core theme of "failing spectacularly" in Jim's talk. A couple of ideas that really resonated with me...

<strong>1. Ideas take the path of least resistance</strong>, and often that's excuses why it won't work. Instead, launch an idea quickly, and if it doesn't work you can scrap it.

<strong>2. Creativity thrives on variety.</strong> Doing one thing really well is great, but  moving from one unique project to another fuels the creative process.
