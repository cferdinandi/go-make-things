Innovation doesn't usually happen in a sudden flash of inspiration. More often, it's the result of imitation, gradual modification, and merger of multiple, unrelated ideas in new and creative ways.

Had I worked fifty or ten or even five years before, I would have failed. So it is with every new thing. Progress happens when all the factors that make for it are ready, and then it is inevitable. To teach that a comparatively few men are responsible for the greatest forward steps of mankind is the worst sort of nonsense.

-Henry Ford</blockquote>
