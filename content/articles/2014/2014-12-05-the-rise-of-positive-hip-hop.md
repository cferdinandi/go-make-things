title: The rise of positive hip-hop
---

A few weeks ago, I found myself frustrated with the current state of hip-hop. The stuff that's "good," for lack of a better word, is hyper-focused on subject matter that's frankly not something I can relate to.

But positive hip-hop is typically really corny. Bad beats. Terrible flows. Awful lyrics.

But, as if it read my mind, iTunes Radio delivered.

## My Favorites

One random day the other week, the iTunes Radio Top 100 Hip-Hop station started playing a bunch of song by artists who are Christian, but aren't Christian rappers. They just make good, positive music.

Some folks you should check out...

### Lecrae

The day this stuff started showing up in iTunes Radio, I heard four of this dude's songs in a row. I'm even hearing him on the Heat on XM Radio.

[All I Need Is You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRTBh1gCjk) is my favorite so far. If you like it, you should also check out [I'm Turnt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiUdrIsqmyQ) and [Say I Won't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yho9Y0xXz0g).

### Tedashii

If you're looking to hyped up, you can't go wrong with [Dum Dum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWwPlldEiUY).

### Andy Mineo

Andy Mineo is from NYC, so his stuff has a more gritty sound than the other guys I've mentioned. I got hooked on [You Can't Stop Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y29FtD3p5V0), but right now [AYO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8HDGF4xzmk) is my jam.

### Trip Lee

Trip Lee is definitely the most overtly Christian of the bunch, and that's not for everyone. Some of his songs are a bit too much for me. But [Insomniac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo3nLF4hmzE) is pretty awesome.

Enjoy!
