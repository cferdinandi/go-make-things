title: How to build a knock-off
---

This is a genius piece of marketing. Dave from <a href="http://www.saddlebackleather.com/">Saddleback Leather</a> put together a short video teaching his competitors <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11wlngpuSY">how to build less expensive (and durable) knock-offs</a> of his product.

What a great way to show off how well made your own product is. (Dave is so confident in his bags that he even <a href="http://www.saddlebackleather.com/Our-Rivals">links to his competitors</a> right in his main site navigation.)
