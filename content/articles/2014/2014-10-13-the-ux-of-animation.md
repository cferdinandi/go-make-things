title: The UX of Animation
---

We're in a period of the web where people are often using animations on sites because they can rather than because they add something to the user experience.

I was delighted to see this example of [animation done right from ReadMe](https://dash.readme.io/login). It's fun, playful, and informative.

I could also see something like this being conditionally activated when using a script that lets users [show or hide their password](https://github.com/cferdinandi/x-ray).

## Animation is easy. Good animation is hard.

At [Artifact Providence](http://artifactconf.com/providence/) this year, I had the pleasure of seeing [Val Head](http://www.valhead.com/) speak about [how to design animation awesomeness](https://speakerdeck.com/valhead/designing-animation-awesomeness-artifact-east). If this is something you're interested, you should definitely give her presentation a look.

You might also enjoy [The Illusion of Life](http://vimeo.com/93206523), a short video from illustrator Cento Lodigiani that visualizes animation concepts from the 1981 book of the same name. (*The video itself was originally attributed to Disney Studios. Cheers to [an anonymous commenter](/the-ux-of-animation/#comment-15036) on the correction.*)
