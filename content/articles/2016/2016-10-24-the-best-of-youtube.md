In my article on [Ditching Cable](/ditching-cable), I mentioned that I watch a lot of geeky, high-quality original programming on YouTube.

Today, I wanted to share a few of my favorites...

## Things You Might Not Know

[Tom Scott](https://www.youtube.com/user/enyay) produces an absurd amount of video explaining cool things you might not know from various places around the world. His videos are short, engaging, and super interesting.

## Vox

[Vox](https://www.youtube.com/user/voxdotcom) is a professional media organization, with a staff of amazingly talented journalists who cover everything from politics to pop culture. Their videos are a mix of short explorations, interviews, and documentaries. I can't recommend this channel enough!

## CGP Grey

An American expat living in Britain, [CGP Grey](https://www.youtube.com/user/CGPGrey) explains things in a fast, information dense, insanely entertaining style. This a quality over quantity channel. The volume is low, but the depth and quality are exceptional.

## The Engineer Guy

Bill Hammack is [the Engineer Guy](https://www.youtube.com/user/engineerguyvideo), a professor at the University of Illinois who explains various marvels of engineering. If you like knowing how stuff works, this is the channel for you!
