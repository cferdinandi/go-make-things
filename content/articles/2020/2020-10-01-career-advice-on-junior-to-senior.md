A few weeks ago, I had the pleasure of [chatting with David Guttman on the Junior to Senior Podcast](https://juniortosenior.io/9) about career development, the lessons I've learned, and how I made the jump from HR guy to web developer.

**On why I changed careers...**

> I hit a point where I was enjoying the tech-web stuff way more than the HR stuff. And that’s when I decided that I wanted to do it for the rest of my career life.

**On why employers forcing you to be in an office is really stupid...**

> I don’t think employers realize... how much it benefits the company when you are remote.

**On finding a job...**

> Job boards just suck. They are the absolute worst way to find a job.
