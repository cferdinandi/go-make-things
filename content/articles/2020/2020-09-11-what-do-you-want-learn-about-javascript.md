For the last three years or so, I've published a new article on vanilla JS or some other web development related topic almost every single weekday.

**Today, I wanted to ask: what do _you_ want to learn about JavaScript?**

I'm going to take a week or two off from writing to refresh and prepare for the next session of [the Vanilla JS Academy](https://vanillajsacademy.com) (probably running some time in October). While I do, I'd love to hear more about the kinds of things you'd like to learn about.

When I come back, I want to hit the ground running with some awesome new articles for you.
