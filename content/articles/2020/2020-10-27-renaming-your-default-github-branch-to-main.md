Yesterday, I wrote about [the importance of removing words rooted in white supremacy from tech](/removing-racist-terms-in-tech/).

One big move GitHub recently made was to change the name of the default branch from `master` to `main`. I've heard from some folks that the mechanics of doing this on older repositories is a bit clunky, so today I wanted to share some resources to make that easier.

- If you're more into watching videos, [Steve Griffith (the Bob Ross of coding) has a short video on the process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04rWoDD-JvQ)
