Way back in March, I announced that [I was working on an advanced version of my Vanilla JS Academy](/how-to-make-the-transition-from-beginner-to-advanced-developer/).

I originally hoped to launch it early summer. Then late summer. Then early fall. I built 80 percent of it, threw it out, and built it again. Then I threw *that* out and rebuilt it again *again*.

I've been having a *really* hard time creating this course in a way that I haven't with any other course I've built before.

Last week, I finally figured out why.

## Modern JS is trash

When students told me the kinds of things they wanted to learn in advanced course, they said things like...

- How to structure large projects
- Building advanced apps with APIs and two-way data
- Token-based login with things like OAuth and JWT
- Offline web apps

These are awesome ideas!

But as I started creating some projects around these topics, and building them out, I invariably ended up drifting towards *modern JS practices*. Things like...

- ES imports and exports
- JS-based routing
- State-based UI
- Single page apps
- Build tools

And these things are, to me, the worst parts of modern web development.

I was building something using tools and approaches I actively avoid in my professional life. And I was doing it because *it's what's expected*. So it felt like an utter slog to get through, and everything I built, I hated.

## Modern JS is awesome

Modern web development might be trash, but *modern JS is awesome*.

There are some many amazing methods and approaches that make stuff that was really hard before really easy. Service workers let you turn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into fully-offline capable web apps that load instantly.

I love the modern JS platform (the stuff the browser does for you), and hate modern JS tooling.

## What does that mean for an Advanced Academy?

Honestly, I'm not entirely sure yet. The way I see it, I have two options:

1. **Try again.** But this time, use *my approaches* to things rather than trying to conform to what I see as bad modern practices. That would mean, for example, skipping JS-based routing and single-page apps in favor of multi-page apps and service workers.
2. **Pivot into other parts of the stack.** I absolutely love working with beginners. I've been wondering if, rather than trying to go deeper into JS, I branch out with a project-based course on introductory HTML and CSS.

Either way, I'd love to hear your thoughts!
