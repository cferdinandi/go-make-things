One common challenge I hear from folks who are learning JavaScript is that they've memorized a bunch of methods and APIs, but they struggle with putting it all together.

How do you break down what you're trying to do into logical steps? How do you convert those steps into code? How do you structure your project? How do you build something that will scale as the project evolves? How do you write code that's easy to maintain?

The truth is, you learn those things by working on lots of projects. You learn by trying things, failing, and trying again. You learn by doing.

But when you're just learning, knowing where to start is hard.

## A project-based training program

Two years ago, I created [the Vanilla JS Academy](https://vanillajsacademy.com) to help students address this gap.

1. **Every other day, you get a project to work on**, 1-3 short lessons that provide some background, and a template to help you get started. 
2. **On the in-between days, I share my approach to the project** and some of the common challenges and “gotchas” that students often run into.

Over the course of ten weeks, you'll work on 35 small projects. The lessons and projects build on each other, so over time, you go from working on small, simple projects to bigger, more complex ones.

Academy is cohort-based program. You'll be learning with a group of other students, and you get access to a private Slack channel where you can share work in progress, ask questions, and help each other learn.

Every other week, I hold a live remote office hours session where you can ask questions, share works in progress, and get help with any big roadblocks.

**Over the course of ten weeks, you'll learn...**

- DOM manipulation, injection, and traversal
- How to transform and edit strings, numbers, arrays, and objects
- ES6 essentials
- How to structure and organize code
- How to save data locally
- Ajax and HTTP
- How to work with APIs
- How to write JavaScript plugins
- How to build framework-free web apps and games
- How to easily write code that works in all browsers
- How to debug broken code
- JavaScript performance tricks
- Web accessibility fundamentals

**A new session of [the Vanilla JS Academy](https://vanillajsacademy.com) starts on October 12, and early bird registration opens today.** If you register this week, you'll save 40% on the cost of the program.
