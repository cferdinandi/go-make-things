On Tuesday, I walked you through [how to convert the Vue.js markdown editor demo to vanilla JS](/converting-the-vue.js-markdown-editor-demo-to-vanilla-js/). A lot of people have told me they're enjoying these types of tutorials, so today, we're doing it again.

This time, we're going to convert [the Vue.js GitHub commits demo](https://vuejs.org/v2/examples/commits.html) to vanilla JS.
