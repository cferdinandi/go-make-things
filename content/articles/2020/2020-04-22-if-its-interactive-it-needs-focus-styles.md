One of my least favorite "things" in web development is this persistent belief that `:focus` styles&mdash;those blue rings that show up around buttons and fields when you're using them&mdash;are bad.

Focus styles serve a critical role in accessibility: they let sighted users who navigate with a keyboard know where exactly they current are in the UI.

Not everyone who uses a keyboard to navigate the web is visually impaired or uses a screen reader. People with Parkinson's, ALS, or other neuromuscular diseases might find moving a cursor with a mouse challenging. Someone with a broken arm or temporary disability may not be able to use a mouse for a short period of time.

My friend Eric Bailey gives a wonderful talk on focus styles, and how they don't _have_ to be ugly, called ["If it's interactive, it needs focus styles."](https://youtu.be/GlraTkcp6Ls?t=1149) Here he is sharing his talk at A11Y Chicago.
