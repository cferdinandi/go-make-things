Today, I thought it might be interesting to try to convert an old jQuery plugin into vanilla JS. I decided to go with [Lettering.js](http://letteringjs.com/), an amazing little plugin from [the folks at Paravel](https://paravelinc.com/).

[I recorded myself working through it](https://vimeo.com/468609606), but didn't end up writing up the process because it takes about twice as long as recording the video does, and I ran out of time.

<div class="fluid-vids"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/468609606?color=0088cc&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
