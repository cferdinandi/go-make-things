Yesterday, I had the chance to [chat with my friend Allie Nimmons about vanilla JS on her show, WP Buffs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H33HnTEl634).

Allie invited me to come onto the show for an AMA, where people asked me some really interesting questions about JavaScript, WordPress, static-site generators, and the future of the web.

I'm so grateful to Allie for having me on. It was an absolute blast!
