Accessibility is hard, and ARIA in particular can get quite confusing. So, I was _really excited_ when I came across [an article from Ben Myers on the difference between `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`, and `aria-describedby`](https://benmyers.dev/blog/aria-labels-and-descriptions/).

> I've [written about ARIA before](https://benmyers.dev/blog/aria/), but this time, I'd like to hone in on three ARIA attributes that, in my experience, are just similar enough to be confusing: `aria‑label`, `aria‑labelledby`, and `aria‑describedby`.

> **Have you used these attributes before?**
>
> If you've used these attributes before, pause here and ask yourself: What's the difference between `aria‑label`, `aria‑labelledby`, and `aria‑describedby`? When might you use one over the other? Can they be used together?

If, like me, you struggle with this stuff, [this article is a great read](https://benmyers.dev/blog/aria-labels-and-descriptions/)!
