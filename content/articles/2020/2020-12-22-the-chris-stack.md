For some reason, I enjoy this kind of thing a lot. Here's _the CHRIS stack_.

```html
C ğŸ‘‰ CSS
H ğŸ‘‰ HTML
R ğŸ‘‰ Really small amounts of JS
I ğŸ‘‰ I canâ€™t stress enough, almost no JS
S ğŸ‘‰ Seriously, use less JS
```

It's always weird a JS educator to advocate _against_ using JavaScript. But generally speaking, JS is the salt on a website. A little bit is good. A lot ruins the whole dish.

So much of what we use JS for today would be better handled with HTML and CSS. It would be more performant, more resilient, and easier to maintain.

Let's make 2021 the year we shift back to mostly static HTML, some CSS, and a dash of JavaScript for flavor.
