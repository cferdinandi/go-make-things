My friend Elaina Natario wrote a _fantastic_ article for the thoughtbot blog on [the difference between `alt` and `figcaption`, and when to use which one](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/alt-vs-figcaption).

> While both the `alt` attribute and the `figcaption` element provide a way to describe images, the way we write for them is different. `alt` descriptions should be functional; `figcaption` descriptions should be editorial or illustrative.

If the difference between the two is confusing to you (like it is for me), do yourself a favor and [go read Elaina's whole article](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/alt-vs-figcaption).

It's very good, very good detailed, and has some great examples of when to use one, the other, or both in conjunction.
