Of all the concepts in JavaScript, wrapping your head around the `this` keyword is one of the most confusing.

It changes in meaning depending where it's used. It's value is different in traditional functions versus arrow functions. When looking at advanced  JS patterns, `this` one of the things that trips up my students the most.

So, I'm delighted that I can now point them to [Steve Griffith's amazingly thorough video on the `this` keyword and lexical scope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWDXgsIgTGk).

Definitely worth a watch if you're still trying to wrap your head around `this`.
