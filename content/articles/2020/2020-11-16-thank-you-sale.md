Letâ€™s make 2021 the year that you master JavaScript.

This year, I decided to skip my big Black Friday to Cyber Monday sale. Instead, I'm running a special _Thank You Sale_ this week as a way to say thanks for all of the love and support you've given me this year.

**Today through Sunday, get 50% off [my pocket guides and video courses](https://vanillajsguides.com), and the February session of the [Vanilla JS Academy](https://vanillajsacademy.com).**

But wait, there's more!

## Bonus gifts!

As an added bonus, if you buy one of my guide/course bundles or register for Academy, **you'll also get $296 worth of free bonus content**.

<ul>
    <li>Watch me live-code vanilla JS projects with the <a href="https://gomakethings.com/live-code/">Vanilla JS Live-Code Series</a>. Follow along, try it yourself first, or dig into the completed source code for over a dozen projects. <em>Valued at $139.</em></li>
    <li>Get hands-on learning with real projects with the <a href="https://gomakethings.com/project-bundle/">Project Bundle</a>. You get starter templates, helpful tips and resources, and step-by-step tutorials. <em>Valued at $79.</em></li>
    <li>Learn how to build insanely fast WordPress sites <a href="https://gomakethings.com/wicked-fast-websites/">Wicked Fast Websites</a>. You'll learn how to measure performance, reduce page weight, and make simple server optimizations. <em>Valued at $39.</em></li>

</ul>
