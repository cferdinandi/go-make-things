My buddy [Heydon](https://heydonworks.com/) (50% of the duo behind [the Every Layout course](https://every-layout.dev/)) just launched [a new video mini-series on web things called Webbed Briefs](https://briefs.video/).

Short, entertaining, informative, and accessible, this series is already a hit. Visit [briefs.video](https://briefs.video/) to watch the pilot episode, and subscribe to future episodes for free.
