This week, [Kieran Barker](https://github.com/kieranbarker) messaged me about a console error he was getting on a project he was working on.

```js
Uncaught TypeError: event.target.matches is not a function at HTMLDocument.<anonymous>
```

He was [using event delegation](/checking-event-target-selectors-with-event-bubbling-in-vanilla-javascript/) with the `matches()` method to detect hover events. And here's an example of the type of code that was triggering that error.

```js
document.addEventListener('mouseenter', function (event) {
	if (event.target.matches('button')) {
		console.log('Found the button!');
	}
}, true);
```

[You can play with this yourself in this CodePen.](https://codepen.io/cferdinandi/pen/ZjqKeo)

Any idea what's going on here? Kieran was kind enough to let me do a live debugging session with him and record it. [Here's the walk-through.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQqe9eLppcw)

**The short version:** the event was also detecting hover events on the parent `document` object, which has no `matches()` method.

To prevent the error, he added a check to make sure `matches()` is supported by the element before trying to use it.

```js
document.addEventListener('mouseenter', function (event) {

	// Make sure it's not the document object
	if (!('matches' in event.target)) return;

	// Do your thing...
	if (event.target.matches('button')) {
		console.log('Found the button!');
	}

}, true);
```
