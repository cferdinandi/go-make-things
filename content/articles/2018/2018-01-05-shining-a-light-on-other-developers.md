title: Shining a light on other developers
---

A couple of months ago, [Brenna Flood shared her experiences being marginalized and pushed aside](https://twitter.com/brennx0r/status/929589909198745600) as her white, male colleagues saw their careers take off.

> During my career, on three separate occasions, I have been in the position of mentoring a male colleague with the hope of being promoted into management, only to find that person being promoted to manage me instead.
> ...
> Eventually, I would work with salary information. More often than not I would see overwhelmingly that the male folks I was leading were making on average $20,000 more than me per year.
> ...
> I feel like this is just the way things are, given that Iâ€™m a woman and the world frankly is ruled by white dudes who only listen to other white dudes.

It's a longer thread on Twitter, but worth reading the whole thing.

After reading about Brenna's experiences, and others like it, I decided that I want to start shining a light on other developers&mdash;particularly those whose voices aren't as readily heard&mdash;whenever I can.

With that in mind, I'm starting a new semi-regular series on this site where I highlight a developer that who's doing awesome things.

## Developer Spotlight: Divya Sasidharan

I met Divya Sasidharan (aka [ShortDiv](http://shortdiv.com/)) about four years ago the first [Artifact Providence Conference](http://artifactconf.com/providence/).

At the time, she was a Digital Media student volunteering at the event. While there, [SparkBox](https://seesparkbox.com/) gave a talk about apprenticeships, and mentioned that they had one. Divya applied, and was selected, and since then, her career has taken off!

Today, she's a web developer at the [Knight Lab](https://knightlab.northwestern.edu/), where she helps push journalism into the future. Divya is [active in the open source community](https://github.com/shortdiv), and last summer, gave her first conference talk [at NEJS](https://2017.nejsconf.com/speakers/divya-sasidharan/) on [Virtual DOM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP6uqQyU-ec).

I [interviewed Divya](https://soundcloud.com/thecardboardrobot/divya-sasidharan) last year for a career guide I wrote. Here's what she had to say about keeping up in an ever changing industry:
