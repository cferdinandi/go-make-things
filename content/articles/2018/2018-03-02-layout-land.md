The [amazing Jen Simmons](http://jensimmons.com/) has put together [a new YouTube channel called Layout Land](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7TizprGknbDalbHplROtag).

If, like me, you still haven't fully wrapped your head around things like flexbox and CSS Grid, this is a great learning resource. And if you're just starting your web development journey, there's plenty of content for you, too.

I'm really looking forward to seeing how this shapes up. [Check out Layout Land on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7TizprGknbDalbHplROtag)
