Yesterday, I released [Bin.js](https://github.com/cferdinandi/bin), a tiny helper library for working with `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`.

A handful of people told me that they enjoy seeing videos of me making stuff---mess ups and all---so [I recorded myself creating the library](https://vimeo.com/296882879) so that you can see my process and how it all works.

Let me know if you have any questions!
