My JS Jabber cohost Aimee Knight recently [jumped on the Microsoft Developer YouTube channel to talk CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c0blZ6AmQE&feature=youtu.be&t=264).

<div class="fluid-vids"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-c0blZ6AmQE?start=261" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

Aimee does an awesome job explaining some of the nuances of CSS and how it works in simple, plain language. I in particular loved her answer to why JavaScript developers should bother learning CSS at all.

**tl;dr:** it's often both easier to implement and more performant than using JS for a lot of things.
