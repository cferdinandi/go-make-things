If you're like me, you probably find `this` in JavaScript a bit weird and confusing.

Fortunately, my buddy [Zac Gordon from JavaScript for WordPress](https://javascriptforwp.com/) has put together [a 3-part video series](https://javascriptforwp.com/this-introduction/)&mdash;for free!&mdash; explaining what is, how it works, when to use it, and some important gotchas.

Here's the first video. [Click through to his article to see all three.](https://javascriptforwp.com/this-introduction/)
