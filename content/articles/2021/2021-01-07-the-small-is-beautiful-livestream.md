Laura Kalbag and Aral Balkan, the duo behind [the Small Technology Foundation](https://small-tech.org/), host [a weekly livestream on small technology and the small web](https://small-tech.org/events/small-is-beautiful/).

If you're a fan of the things I promote here, you'll love what they're all about: private, inclusive, simple and open technology.

The next session is today at 5PM Cork (UTC +0) / 12PM New York (UTC -5) / 9AM San Francisco (UTC -8). It's totally free to attend, and today, they'll be talking about [Site.js, a small tool for building websites](https://sitejs.org/).
