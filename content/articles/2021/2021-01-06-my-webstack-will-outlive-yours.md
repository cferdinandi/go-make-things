This week, I wrote a bit about [whether or not you need build tools](/do-you-need-build-tools/).

Related to my thoughts on using build tools only when they simplify my build process, Steren Giannini wrote a great article last month on [the beauty of building websites using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript](https://blog.steren.fr/2020/my-stack-will-outlive-yours/).

> My stack requires no maintenance, has perfect Lighthouse scores, will never have any security vulnerability, is based on open standards, is portable, has an instant dev loop, has no build step and… will outlive any other stack.

It resonates with me really strongly. [I'd recommend reading the whole thing.](https://blog.steren.fr/2020/my-stack-will-outlive-yours/)
