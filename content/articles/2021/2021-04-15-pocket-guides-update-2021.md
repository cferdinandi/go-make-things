JavaScript and the browser environment have changed quite a bit since I first released [the Vanilla JS Pocket Guides](https://vanillajsguides.com) a few years ago.

A lot of the techniques and approaches I recommended in them have been replaced by newer, modern ones that result in less code and a better developer experience. IE is now a deprecated browser.

Today, I released a completely updated set of Pocket Guides, with new methods and modern JS approaches.

**If you already own my pocket guides, this is a free update.** You can download or watch the new guides from the [learner portal](https://courses.gomakethings.com).

**If you don't own any guides yet, you can save 30% on any guide or bundle.** Today through April 25, use the code `ModernJS30` at checkout.

Here's what's new...

## Updates for all guides

- Older, more verbose techniques have been replaced with modern methods that do the same thing more simply.
- Any helper functions that have been replaced by modern JS methods have been removed.
- I no longer recommend polyfills, since all of the included methods work as-is in all modern browsers on desktop and mobile.
- All of the videos now include closed captions.

## DOM Manipulation

- `for...of` loops
- `NodeList.forEach()` natively
- Modern `addEventListener()` syntax
- Difference between attributes and properties
- New project: Toggle password visibility

## Strings & Numbers

- Template literals are now fully supported and recommended
- `String.replaceAll()`
- `String.splice()`
- `String.includes()`

## Arrays & Objects

- `Array.includes()`
- `Array.findIndex()`
- `for...of` loops
- `Array.shift()`
- `Array.pop()`
- Optional chaining with objects
- Immutability in multidimensional objects and arrays
- `Object.freeze()`
- The spread syntax
- Array and object destructuring
- Object property shorthand syntax

## Variables, Functions, & Scope

- `var`, `let`, `const`, and why you should generally use `let`
- Block scope
- Default function parameters
- Rest parameters
- Documenting functions with JSDoc

## DOM Injection & Traversal

- `Element.outerHTML`
- `Element.innerText`
- Removed legacy methods in favor of simpler modern methods: `Node.insertBefore()`, `Node.appendChild()`, `Node.removeChild()`
- `Node.replaceWith()`
- `Node.cloneNode()`
- XSS and URLs
- Improved string encoding method
- `Node.firstChild`
- `Node.lastChild`
- `Node.firstElementChild`
- `Node.lastElementChild`
- `Node.nextSibling`
- `Node.previousSibling`
- `Node.nextElementSibling`
- `Node.previousElementSibling`
- Dropped legacy viewport height and width methods
- `Element.getBoundingClientRect()`
- Intersection Observer API

## Browser Storage

- Expanded cookie options and settings
- Deep-dive into the IndexedDB API, which now accounts for over half the guide

## APIs & Async

- `Promise.finally()`
- Fetching multiple APIs
- Detailed look at `async` and `await`
- Expanded section on API authentication: Basic Auth and token-based authentication
- High-level overview of setting up your own middleman API
- XSS and URLs
- Improved string encoding method

## Writing Plugins is now Writing Libraries

This guide includes totally new recommendations and approaches.

- What is a JS library?
- Libraries vs. helper functions
- Simple utility libraries
- The Revealing Module Pattern
- The Constructor Pattern
- Optional chaining
- Why prototypes are better for performance
- Private data with the constructor pattern and prototypes
- How to destroy a library instance
- Custom event naming conventions
- New project: a browser storage library

## NEW: ES Modules

This is a brand new guide with all new content.

- What ES modules are, and when and why to use them.
- How to `import` and `export` ES modules.
- How to `import` all exports as an object.
- How to rename functions and variables when importing and exporting them.
- What ES module side-effects are, and how to use them.
- Code structure, nested modules, and common issues.
- Scoping with ES modules.
- Performance implications when using native ES modules.
- How to use rollup.js to bundle modules.
- What tree shaking is, and why its important.

## Web Apps

No changes, but this guide has been removed from the Advanced Bundle (if you already purchased it you will still have access).

It's being rewritten as a guide to State-Based UI, to more accurately reflect it's content and newer best practices.
