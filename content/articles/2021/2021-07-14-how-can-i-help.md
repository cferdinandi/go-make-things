Lately, I've been thinking _a lot_ about how I can both help more people learn JavaScript, and help my existing students learn even more.

**So, today, I have a question: are there any specific things you wish I did or offered to help you learn JS (or adjacent tech)?**

Some ideas I've been thinking about:

- Private, one-on-one coaching video calls (either ongoing or as one-off)
- Group coaching, with biweekly video office hours and open Q&A
- Project tutorials or videos (either pre-planned or live "let me figure this out" style)
- Guides on stuff like service workers, serverless, testing, device APIs, and more
- {Your awesome idea...}

If you have any thoughts, I'd love to hear them! [You can reach me here.](/about)
