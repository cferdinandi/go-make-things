One of the biggest challenges I hear from people who are learning to code is making the transition from learning specific methods and techniques to actually starting a project.

It's easy enough to memorize (or, as I often do, look up) how to find elements in the DOM or filter items from an array.

**But when you have a brand new project or task in front of you, where do you start?**

That's why I created the [Vanilla JS Academy](https://vanillajsacademy.com). A new session starts on February 1, and today through Sunday, you can register for 40% off.

## How it works

The Vanilla JS Academy is a project-based online JavaScript training program for beginners.

- **Every other day, you get a project to work on,** 1-3 short lessons that provide some background, and a template to help you get started. 
- **On the in-between days, I share my approach to the project** and some of the common challenges and “gotchas” that students often run into.

If you get stuck, there’s a **24/7 private Slack channel** exclusively for students, and **video office hours** every other week.

## A focus on problem solving

Unlike most courses, in Academy I _don't_ give you all the answers, and I don't immediately show you how to complete the project.

**The goal of the Vanilla JS Academy is teach you how to solve problems.**

Along the way, you'll learn how to break project briefs into a series of small tasks, how to translate tasks into code, and how to debug your code when things don't work the way you expected. You'll learn how to search for approaches to problems, and evaluate whether or not the solutions are good ones.

If you want to learn how to _think in code_, or you're tired for feeling like you just don't know where to start, Academy is for you.

## What you'll learn

The Vanilla JS Academy covers a wide range of topics, including...

- DOM manipulation, injection, and traversal
- How to transform and edit strings, numbers, arrays, and objects
- ES6 essentials
- How to structure and organize code
- How to save data locally
- Ajax and HTTP
- How to work with APIs
- How to write JavaScript plugins
- How to build framework-free web apps and games
- How to easily write code that works in all browsers
- How to debug broken code
- JavaScript performance tricks
- Web accessibility fundamentals

You can view the full schedule on the specific projects you'll work on at [the Vanilla JS Academy website](https://vanillajsacademy.com/).
