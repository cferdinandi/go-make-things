Yesterday, I wrote about [web development and climate change](/web-development-and-climate-change/).

Adam, a reader who works in digital sustainability, reached out with a handful of additional resources on sustainable web development.

- [Sustainable Web Manifesto](https://www.sustainablewebmanifesto.com/)
- [Sustainable Web Design](https://sustainablewebdesign.org/)
- [Website Carbon Calculator](https://www.websitecarbon.com/)
- [The Green Web Foundation](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/)
- [ClimateAction.tech](https://climateaction.tech/)
- [The _Sustainable Web Design Book_ from A Book Apart](https://abookapart.com/products/sustainable-web-design)

Take a look. Thanks Adam!
