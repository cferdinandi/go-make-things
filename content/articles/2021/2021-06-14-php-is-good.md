> modern web dev is an extreme overreaction to not liking some php

The weird thing, PHP is regularly attacked as "a shitty language," and our profession goes out of its way to make JavaScript _the one true language_.

But PHP is great, and so many of the "hey look what we can do now!" features I've seen in people's favorite JS frameworks are things PHP has been able to do for many, many years.

PHP has flaws, sure. All languages do.

But it has great documentation, tons of tooling, runs on pretty much any server, and it gets shit done. PHP is the workhorse of the web.

And while languages like Ruby have great "batteries included" defaults and Go is absurdly fast, PHP just keeps plugging along getting things done.

Long live PHP!
