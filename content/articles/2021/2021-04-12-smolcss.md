Like JavaScript, CSS has come _a long way_ over the last few years.

Stuff that used to be really hard is now a lot easier, and can be handled in just a few lines of code instead of many. Cross-browser support is great, too!

This is such an amazing resource, whether you're just learning CSS or have been using it for years. Check it out at [SmolCSS.dev](https://smolcss.dev/).
