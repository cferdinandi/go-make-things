Grace Hopper was a pioneer in computer science, an amazingly talented programmer, and the person most often attributed to one of my favorite quotes:

> A ship in port is safe, but that's not what ships are built for.

So I absolutely adored every second of [this clip from a talk she gave back in 1993](https://youtu.be/Sn0f0vpn8jE?t=69) on the importance of performance, understanding your code, and asking for forgiveness instead of permission when trying to get stuff done in a space where out-of-touch stalwarts gatekeep who can do things.

> So I want to tell something to all the young people here. On many, many, many occasions, you'll find it is much easier to apologize than it is to get permission.
>
> You do it. Then when someone comes after you and says, "Are you supposed to do that?" you go, "Oh gee, I didn't know I wasn't supposed to do that."

Go watch the whole thing if you have a few minutes. It's really good!
