If you're interested in building websites and web apps that work for everyone, you should checkout [Inclusive Design Principles](https://inclusivedesignprinciples.org/), from [Henny Swan](https://twitter.com/iheni), [Ian Pouncey](https://twitter.com/IanPouncey), [Heydon Pickering](https://twitter.com/heydonworks), and [Léonie Watson](https://twitter.com/LeonieWatson).

> These Inclusive Design Principles are about putting people first. It's about designing for the needs of people with permanent, temporary, situational, or changing disabilities — all of us really.
>
> They are intended to give anyone involved in the design and development of websites and applications - designers, user experience professionals, developers, product owners, idea makers, innovators, artists and thinkers - a broad approach to inclusive design.
