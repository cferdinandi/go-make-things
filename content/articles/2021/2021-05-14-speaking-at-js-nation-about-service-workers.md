[JSNation Live](https://live.jsnation.com/) is online conference running from June 9-11. I'll be there speaking about service workers, and why I think they can (and should) replace some of our old best practices.

We&mdash;web developers&mdash;have broken the web. We’ve built the front end around JavaScript, which is a fragile house of cards... it’s unreliable and easily broken.

Service workers are a newerish tool in our toolkit that provide more resilience in the things that we build.

They can make our sites faster, and allow us to build websites and apps that continue to function even when things go wrong.

Join met at [JSNation Live](https://live.jsnation.com/) this June as I talk about service workers: what they are, how they work, and different strategies for implementing them.
