Last week, I was [on the HTML All the Things podcast talking about how modern JS is ruining the web](https://dev.to/mikhailkaran/how-modern-javascript-is-ruining-the-web-w-chris-ferdinandi-5eo3).

Matt, Mike, and I talked about a _bunch_ of stuff, including...

- Our tendency as an industry to over-engineer things
- When frameworks are actually the right choice, and when they're not
- How modern libraries are paving cow paths for the future of JS
- What to do if you're just starting out in the industry
- Thoughts on learning
