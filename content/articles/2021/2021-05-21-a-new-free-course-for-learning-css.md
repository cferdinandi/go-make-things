Google just launched [a new free course for learning CSS](https://web.dev/learn/css/).

It covers everything from fundamental concepts like specificity and the cascade to grids and layouts through intermediate and advanced topics like gradients, filters, and animations.

It was created by [my good friend Andy Bell](https://piccalil.li/) and [CSS superstar Rachel Andrew](https://www.rachelandrew.co.uk/) (along with some fine folks working at Google). I can't think of a better team to build something like this!

It includes tons of working demos on CodePen that you can fork and play around with, and just looks really, really good.

If you've been wanting to learn CSS, or dig deeper into some of its concepts, go check it now at [web.dev/learn/css](https://web.dev/learn/css/).
