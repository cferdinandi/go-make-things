Historically, getting data from a form into a format you could send to an API was a bit difficult, but modern techniques make it a lot easier.

## The FormData object

The `FormData` object provides an easy way to serialize form fields into key/value pairs.

You can use the `new FormData()` constructor to create a new FormData object, passing in the form to serialize as an argument. Form fields must have a `name` attribute to be included object. Otherwise, they're skipped. The `id` property doesn't count.

For example, if you have a form that looked like this...

```html
<form id="post">

	<label for="title">Title</label>
	<input type="text" name="title" id="title" value="Go to the beach">

	<label for="body">Body</label>
	<textarea id="body" name="body">Soak up the sun and swim in the ocean.</textarea>

	<input type="hidden" name="userId" value="1">

	<button>Submit</button>

</form>
```

You would serialize it like this...

```js
// Get the form
let form = document.querySelector('#post');

// Get all field data from the form
// returns a FormData object
let data = new FormData(form);
```

## Looping through FormData

The `FormData` object is an iterable, which means you can loop through it [using a `for...of` loop](/the-for...of-loop-in-vanilla-js/) (_you'll notice that a trend with many of the newer JS methods_).

Each `entry` in the loop is an array of key/value pairs.

```js
// logs...
// ["title", "Go to the beach"]
// ["body", "Soak up the sun and swim in the ocean."]
//Â ["userId", "1"]
for (let entry of data) {
	console.log(entry);
}
```

Because the `entry` values are arrays, you can also [use array destructuring](/destructing-in-vanilla-js/#array-destructuring) to assign the `key` and `value` to their own variables within the `for...of` loop.

```js
// logs "title", "Go to the beach", etc.
for (let [key, value] of data) {
	console.log(key);
	console.log(value);
}
```

## Adding, updating, and removing items from a FormData object

The `FormData` object has several methods that you can use to add, remove, and update items.

Use the `FormData.set()` method to replace an existing entry, or add a new one if an entry with that key doesn't exist. Pass in the `key` and `value` as arguments.

```js
// Updates the userId field with a new value
data.set('userId', '3');

// Creates a new key, "date", with a value of "4"
data.set('date', 'July 4');
```

Use the `FormData.append()` method to add a new entry, passing in the `key` and `value` as arguments. If an item with that `key` already exists, another one is added and the existing one is unaffected.

```js
// Add a second "body" key to the data FormData object
data.append('body', 'Eat ice cream');
```

Use the `FormData.delete()` method to delete an entry, passing in the `key` as an argument. If more than one item with that `key` exist, all of them are deleted.

```js
// Delete items with the "body" key
data.delete('body');
```

## How to convert a FormData object into an object or query string

The FormData object _can_ be submitted as-is to some endpoints with a `content-type` header of `multipart/form-data`, not not all APIs support that.

To serialize a `FormData` object into a query string, pass it into the `new URLSearchParams()` constructor. This will create a `URLSearchParams` object of encoded query string values.

Then, call the `URLSearchParams.toString()` method on it to convert it into a query string.

```js
// Get the form
let form = document.querySelector('#post');

// Get all field data from the form
let data = new FormData(form);

// Convert to a query string
let queryString = new URLSearchParams(data).toString();
```

To serialize a `FormData` object into a plain object, we need to loop through each entry with a `for...of` loop and add it to an object.

```js
let obj = {};
for (let [key, value] of data) {
	obj[key] = value;
}
```

Here's a helper function you can use to convert a `FormData` object into a plain object. Pass in the `FormData` object as an argument.

```js
function serialize (data) {
	let obj = {};
	for (let [key, value] of data) {
		obj[key] = value;
	}
	return obj;
}
```

And here's how you would use it.

```js
// Get the form
let form = document.querySelector('#post');

// Get all field data from the form
let data = new FormData(form);

// Convert to an object
let formObj = serialize(data);
```

Tomorrow, we'll look at how to submit our serialized data to an API.
