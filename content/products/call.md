## Here's how it works

1-on-1 Coaching Calls take place over Skype and entitle you to ask me anything about whatever JavaScript challenges you’re facing. I'll give you immediate advice about what to do next.

Typical areas of interest include:

- The best way to approach a particular task or challenge.
- How to structure your code.
- How to ensure your code will work across a variety of browsers and devices.

I’ll give you specific advice and share code snippets that you can put into action immediately based on my years of writing code for some of the world’s best organizations.

You are welcome to record the call for future reference. Once you submit your payment, you’ll receive a link to schedule a 60 minute appointment in my calendar.
