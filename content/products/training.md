## How it works

I offer half-day, full-day, and multi-day workshops that include a mix of **lectures**, **live examples**, and **hands-on projects**. Participants leave the workshop with:

- **All of the source code** from the examples and projects.
- PDF copies of **all of my slides**.

## They also get these awesome bonuses

In addition to the workshop and course materials, all training participants receive these valuable bonus materials:

- Access to my private **Vanilla JS Slack room**, where you can chat with other members, get feedback on code, ask questions, and share the latest tips, tricks, and strategies for going vanilla JavaScript.
- **The Complete Set of Vanilla JS Pocket Guides**, my short, focused training guides for beginners.
- My **vanilla JavaScript toolkit**, packed with cheat sheets, code snippets, boilerplates, helper functions, polyfills, and a growing list of recommended vanilla JS plugins.
